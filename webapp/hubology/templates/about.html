		<p>
			The primary goal of the hub-ology movement is to get good problem solvers living in 
			rural areas excited about computers.  It attempts to do this by focusing on three things:
			<strong>Inspire</strong>, <strong>Educate</strong>, and <strong>Do</strong>.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			By arming people with skills learned from computer science, we hope to create 
			new economic opportunities for people living in small towns.  We also hope that 
			some of these people will give back by <strong>doing</strong> something great 
			in their small town.  If you're passionate about education, you can help out 
			by volunteering to work with local educators to weave computer science into 
			their existing course work. If you're an entrepreneur, you could start your next
			tech company in a small town that could really use the jobs.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			We know the world faces many complex problems.
			We're confident that the hub-ology movement will produce
			new groups of deep thinking problem solvers that will tackle the biggest
			of problems from the smallest of towns for the benefit of all.
